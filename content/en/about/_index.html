log2rbac-operator is a cloud-native app that implements the Operator design pattern. It runs in Kubernetes and extends the Kubernetes API by introducing a new custom resource called `RbacNegotiation`.
The operators implements the control loop for those custom resources and when requested, it starts recording the logs of an application that was specified in the `RbacNebotiation` spec. Using those logs it turns
all the RBAC violations into exceptions and gradually builds the `Role` for your application.
